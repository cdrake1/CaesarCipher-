# CaesarCipher-
What is the Caesar Cipher? Well...the Caesar Cipher was originally created and used by **Julius Caesar** during the reign of the **Roman Empire** in order to encrypt messages for military communication. The Caesar Cipher works by choosing a shift value and shifting the letters within a message that amount of characters up or down the alphabet. For example, shifting 3 places would mean the letter **'a'** is now represented as **'d'**. This same process works for decrypting the message. You can also break or solve the Caesar Cipher by taking the secret message and iterating through each possible shift value... **1-26**. Now, the purpose of this repository was to implement each aspect of the Caesar Cipher in different languages. I did this with 10 different programming languages in order to learn how to adapt to different types of coding. Although my programs arent perfect, it was fun to experience some langauges of the past, present, and future! Enjoy!
